### Suspense and WIP Report UIPath Automation
#### Project 2

For the Suspense Report, these are representative of files where costs have been outlaid, but
havenâ€™t been placed into JRB for billing. We need these files to be flipped to JRB so we can
capture the revenue.

For the WIP Report, these are files where additional costs have been added, the IAE needs to
review and determine if the customer should be charged for these additional costs. Please
determine and flip to JRB. If the additional charges should not be billed back to the customer,
please provide an explanation as to why charges should not be pushed back to the customer.
